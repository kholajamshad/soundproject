Project Name: NYUAD Campus Cats Tour


Project Description: This project is an interactive website [made by] NYUAD campus cats who give a tour of their favorite spots on campus. The theme is playful and fun and from the cats' perspective. 


Process: We wanted to make the website look like it was created by cats, hence the playful icons and bright colors and scratch marks and paw prints :) We then proceeded to give the tour from the cats' perspective instead of humans so not everything they say is entirely true.


Reflection/Evaluation: We were initially going for a vertical slider where the image that you select enlarges and the others are a little faded but this changed as we progressed. It was a little difficult to combine the images with cartoon icons on the page but it did not turn too bad. We were a little worried about the sound quality but we tried noise reduction and added background music and it turned out fine.
