Project Name: 
NYUAD Campus Cats Tour


Project Description:
This project is an interactive website [made by] NYUAD campus cats who give a tour of their favorite spots on campus. The theme is playful and fun and from the cats' perspective.


Process: 
We wanted to make the website look like it was created by cats, hence the playful icons and bright colors and scratch marks and paw prints :) We then proceeded to give the tour from the cats' perspective instead of humans so not everything they say is entirely true. We decided to design the icons/buttons and the background ourselves and match their color and style to the actual cats so that we have a consistent and unique aesthetic. We chose to give a different voice to each cat to give them a distinct identity and character. By adding background noises from the location to the dialogue we wanted to create a different experience and journey for each catâ€™s territory. By giving the user a choice to hear in cat and English translation for a more involved cat experience. And finally, by adding a welcome page we wanted the user to know what to expect and clarify that the tour was being hosted by cats.


Reflection/Evaluation:
We were initially going for a vertical slider (where the image that you select enlarges and the others are a little faded) but this changed as we progressed. It was a little difficult to combine the images with cartoon icons on the page, but it did not turn too bad. We were a little worried about the sound quality, so we tried noise reduction and added background music and it turned out fine. We had some struggle with layout and the user interactivity and changed some details several times until we were happy with it.
