Project Name: 
NYUAD Campus Cats Tour


Project Description:
This project is an interactive website [made by] NYUAD campus cats who give a tour of their favorite spots on campus. The theme is playful and fun and from the cats' perspective.


Process: 
We wanted to make the website look like it was created by cats, hence the playful icons, bright colors, scratch marks and paw prints were incorporated into the visual design :) We then proceeded to give the tour from the cats' perspective instead of humans so that it is a very subjective (and not entirely true) telling of the story. We decided to design the icons/buttons and the background ourselves and match their color and style to the actual cats so that we have a consistent and unique aesthetic. We chose to give a different voice to each cat to give them a distinct identity and character that is also reflected in the script they are following, whether it be a lazy cat or a playful one. By adding background noises from the location to the dialogue we wanted to create a different experience and journey for each catâ€™s territory. The sound is the highlight of the experience as the audio storytelling is the only way for the user to get an image of what the campus is like. By giving the user a choice to hear in cat and English translation, we felt the experience would be a lot more involved and dynamic. Of course the meows were all recorded from campus on cats for the authentic experience. And finally, by adding a welcome page we wanted the user to know what to expect and clarify that the tour was being hosted by cats.


Reflection/Evaluation:
We were initially going for a vertical slider (where the image that you select enlarges and the others are a little faded) but this changed as we progressed since we felt that it did not match the fun and cartoonish feel of the audio recordings and concept of cat tour guides. It was a little difficult to combine the images with cartoon icons on the page since we did not want to visually overwhelm the user but it tuerned out to play well together and have a cute yet polished look. We were a little worried about the sound quality, so we tried noise reduction and added background music to try and refine it which worked fairly well. The volume or "presence" of the background audio was also kept different for the cats, for instance near the arts center where its usually very loud the background was made more overwhelming while near D1 where its normally quiet, the human speech is much clearer and louder than the background. We had a fair amount of struggle with deciding the layout for the website with regards to the user experience with controlling the sound and selecting the different sounds available. For instance, we initially had a separate play button but we realized that it made the process too long and complicated for the user (as well as from a javascript sound programming perspective) so we decided to remove it and use our language buttons as the primary play and pause. We also had to ensure that there was no overlap of audios playing either for the same cat or for different ones. Perhaps the most troublesome elements were trying to figure out spacing on the page and keeping all the separate elements aligned on resizing which could still be improved. Overall, our intentions with the visual feel and the role of the audio in the website came across fairly well and we accomplished the tasks we had set out to with the project.
